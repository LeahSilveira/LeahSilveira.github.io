			<p> My name is Leah Silveira, and it's very nice to meet you! I'm a photographer based in the Bay Area of California. Although my favorite medium is photography, I tend to dabble in different mediums as well. Throughout my life, I have endeavored to retain my sense of wonder. I have seen countless people grow up and lose the childlike spark that once inspired them to dream. We are all born with the ability to be awed and dazzled by everyday life, yet most people lose it before their life really begins. It is this childlike wonder that drives me to explore my world as an artist. Through my work, I strive to inspire others and help people experience beauty and joy. I hope to inspire myself and others along the way. Through the rest of my art practice, regardless of the project, my goal is to surprise people. Whether it is portrait work, event photography, or art commissions, my goal is to surpass the expectations of my clients. Through my work, I aim to show people a different side of the subject they would not notice at first glance. In all that I do, I love to express the world I see through my camera lens. This world is a hard place to live in, but I hope my work can bring some joy and wonder into it, if only for a moment.
